The Rooster and the Pearl
One day a Rooster hijacked
A Pearl He gave
To the beautiful first Lapidary.
I believe it fine, he said,
But the slightest grain of millet
My case would be much better.
An ignorant inherited
From a manuscript he carried
At his neighbor the Bookseller.
I believe, he said, that he is good
But the slightest ducaton
My case would be much better.
