The Lion Shot by Man
We were exposing a painting
Where the craftsman had traced
A lion of immense stature
By one man who was destroyed.
The lookers took glory.
A Lion by the way pulled down their caquet:
“I can see,” he said, “that indeed
We give you victory here;
But the worker disappointed you:
He was free to pretend.
With more reason we would have the top,
If my colleagues knew how to paint.”
