Fox and Grapes
Some Fox Gascon, others say Normand,
Almost starving, lives on top of a trellis
Apparently ripe grapes,
And covered with a vermeille skin.
The gallant would have made it a meal;
But as there could not be:
“They are too green,” he said, “and good for goujats.”
Did he not do better than complain?
