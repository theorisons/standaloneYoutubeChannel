The Mountain that gives birth
A mountain in a child's trouble
Thrown such a loud clamor,
Let everyone, with the rushing noise,
She thought she'd give birth without fail
From a city bigger than Paris:
She gave birth to a mouse.
When I think of this fable,
Whose story is a liar
And the meaning is true,
I figure an author
Who says, “I will sing war
What did the Titans do to the Master of Thunder.”
It's promising a lot: but what often comes out of it?
Wind.
