Donkey carrying relics
A Baudet, loaded with relics,
Imagined we loved him:
In this thinking it is carrait,
Receiving as his own incense and hymns.
Someone saw the mistake, and said to him,
“Master Baudet, get away from the mind
A vanity so crazy.
It's not you, it's the Idol.
To whom this honor is surrendere,
And that glory is due.”
From an ignorant magister
That's the dress we salute.
