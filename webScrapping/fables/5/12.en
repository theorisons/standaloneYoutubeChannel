Doctor Tant-Pis was going to see a sick person
What was also visited by his colleague Tant-Better.
The latter hoped, although his comrade
That the lying man would go to see his ancestors.
Both found themselves different for the cure
Their sick man paid the price in kind,
After that in his advice Tant-Pis had been believed.
They still triumphed over this disease.
One said, “He's dead; I had planned it.
“If he had believed me, “said the other, “he would be full of life.”
