The Hare and the Partridge | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 5 Fable 17

___

Never mock the wretched:
Because who can make sure he's always happy?
The wise Aessop in his fables
Give us an example or two.
The one in these verses I propose,
And his people are the same thing.
The Hare and the Partridge, fellow citizens of a field,
Lived in a state, it seems, quite quiet,
When a pack approaching
Requires the first to seek asylum:
He runs away to his fort, puts the dogs in defects,
Without even the exception of Brifaut.
Finally he betrays himself.
By the spirits coming out of his heated body.
Miraut, on their smell having philosopher,
Concludes that it is his Hare, and of extreme ardor
He pushes him; and Rustaut, who never lied,
Says the Hare is gone.
The poor poor man comes to die at his house.
The Partridge rals him and says,
â€œYou bragging about being so fast!
What did you do with your feet? As she laughs,
Her turn is coming; she is found. She believes that her wings
will be able to guarantee it at any end;
But poverty had counted
Without the surrounding to cruel greenhouses.
