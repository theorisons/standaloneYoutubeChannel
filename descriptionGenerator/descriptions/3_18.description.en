The Cat and an old Rat | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 3 Fable 18

___

I read at a Fables' storyteller.
That a second Rodilard, the Alexander of Cats,
Attila, the scourge of the Rats,
It made these last miserable:
I read, I said, in some author,
That this exterminator chat,
True Cerberus, was feared a league round:
He wanted to mice to depopulate everyone.
The boards that we hang on a light support,
The rat dead, the mouse,
Were only games at the price of him.
As he sees that in their dens
The mice were prisoner.
That they dared to go out, that he was looking for.
The gallant makes death, and from the top of a floor
Hanged upside down: the villain beast
At some cords stood a paw.
The mice people believe that it is punishment,
That he made a steal of rôt or cheese,
Scratched someone, caused some damage,
I mean, we hung the wrong boy.
All, I say, unanimously
Promise to laugh at his funeral,
Put the nose in the air, show a little head,
Then go into their ratchet nests,
Then coming out make four steps,
Then finally go on a search.
But here's another party:
The hanged man is raised, and on his falling feet,
Catch the lazy ones.
“We know more than one,” he said, while gobbling them:
It's old war tower; and your hollow caves
Will not save you, I warn you:
You will all come to the house.”
He prophesied true: our master Mitis,
For the second time, deceive them and refine them.
Whitens her dress and gets engaged.
And, in this way disguised,
Nests and snuggles in an open hut.
It was to him well advised:
The Gent Trotte-Menu is looking for its loss.
A Rat, no more, refrain from going to smell around:
He was an old truck, he knew more than one ride;
Even he lost his tail in battle.
“This flare-floured block doesn't tell me anything worth,
He cried from afar to the general cats.
I suspect there's still some machine underneath.
Nothing serves you to be flour;
Because when you're a bag, I wouldn't come near.”
That was well said to him; I agree with his caution:
He was experiment,
And knew that distrust
Is the mother of security.
