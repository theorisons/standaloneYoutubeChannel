The Two Pigeons | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 9 Fable 2

___

Two Pigeons loved each other with tender love:
One of them, bored at logistics,
Was crazy enough to undertake
A trip to a distant country.
The other one said, “What are you going to do?
Would you like to leave your brother?
Absence is the greatest of ailments:
Not for you, cruel! At least, that the work,
Hazards, travel care,
Change your courage a little.
Again, if the season went further!
Wait for the zephyrs: who hurts you? a raven
Earlier announced misfortune to some bird.
I will only think of a funeste,
That hawks, that networks. Alas, I will say, it is raining:
Does my brother have everything he wants,
Good supper, good lodging, and the rest? ”
This speech shaken the heart
From our reckless traveler;
But the desire to see and the mood worries
finally took him away. He said, “Do not weep;
Three days at most will make my soul satisfied:
I will come back in a little tale from point to point
My adventures to my brother;
I'll disagree with him. Anyone who doesn't see
Has little to say too. My journey depicts
You will be of extreme pleasure.
And I will say, I was there; this thing happened to me:
You'll think you're yourself.”
To these words, as they cried, they said goodbye.
The traveler is moving away: and now a cloud
Forces him to seek retirement in some place.
Only one tree was offered, such as the storm
Maltraita the Pigeon despite the foliage.
The air has become serene, he leaves all bitten.
Dries as best he can his body loaded with rain;
In a remote field sees widespread wheat,
Sees a pigeon near: it makes him want;
He flies there, he is caught: this wheat covered with a lake,
Liars and traitors appas.
The lakes were worn out, so that, from his wing,
From its feet, from its beak, the bird finally breaks it:
Some feather perished there, and the worse of fate
Was that a certain vulture, in the cruel greenhouse,
Lives our unfortunate, who, dragging the string
And the pieces of the lakes that caught him,
Seemed like an escaped convict.
The vulture was going to bind him, when naked
In turn melts an eagle with extended wings.
The Pigeon took advantage of the robbery conflict,
flew away, fell down to a masure,
Thoughts, for this blow, that his misfortunes
Wish to end up with this adventure;
But a child's fripon (this age is mercilessly)
Took his sling, and then killed more than half
The unfortunate volative,
Who, cursing his curiosity,
Dragging the wing and pulling the foot,
Half-dead and half-lame.
Right to the house returned:
That well, that bad, she comes,
No other unfortunate adventure.
These are our people joined; and I leave to judge
How many pleasures they paid for their sorrows.
Lovers, happy lovers, do you want to travel?
Let it be on the next shore.
Are you to each other an ever-beautiful world,
Always diverse, always new;
Stand in place of everything, count for nothing the rest.
I sometimes liked: I wouldn't have then,
Against the Louvre and its treasures,
Against the firmament and its heavenly vault
Changed the woods, changed the places
Honored by the steps, illuminated by the eyes
From the kind and young shepherdess
For whom, under the son of Kythera,
I served, hired by my first oaths.
Alas! when will such moments come back?
Is it necessary that so many objects so sweet and so charming
Let me live at the will of my troubled soul?
Ah! if my heart dared to fire again!
Will I not feel any more charm that stops me?
Have I spent the time loving?
