The Merchant, the Gentilman, the Pastre and the King's Son | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 10 Fable 15

___

Four researchers from the new worlds
Almost naked escaped from the fury of the waves,
A trafficker, a Noble, a Pastre, a Son of a King,
Reduced to the lot of Belisaire,
Asked passers-by what
To be able to alleviate their misery.
To tell what fate had assembled them,
Although all four of them were born under various points,
It's a long story.
They finally sat at the edge of a fountain:
There the council stood between the poor people.
The Prince spread over the misfortune of the great ones.
Le Pastre was of the opinion that pushing away the thought
From their past adventure,
Everyone did their best, and applied to the care
To provide for the common need.
“Does the complaint, “he added, “heal her man?
Let's work: it's enough to lead us to Rome.”
A Pastre so speak! So to speak; is it believed
May Heaven have given only to the crowned heads
Of mind and reason,
And that of every shepherd, as of every sheep,
Is knowledge limited?
The opinion of it was first found good
By the three stranded on the edge of America.
One was the Merchant, knew the arithmetic:
“At so much a month,” he said, “I will teach.
— I will teach politics,”
Retaken the King's Son. The Noble continued:
“I know the coat of arms; I want to keep school.”
As if, before India, we would have had in the mind,
The foolish vanity of this frivolous jargon!
The Pastre said: “Friends, you speak well; but what!
The month is thirty days; until that time
Will we fast by your faith?
You give me hope
Beautiful, but far away; and yet I am hungry.
Who will provide us for tomorrow's dinner?
Or rather on what insurance
Do you melt, tell me, today's supper?
First of all, it's the one
This is about. Your science
Is short on this: my hand will replace it.”
To these words, the Pastre goes away
In a wood, he made faggots there, and the sale of them.
On this day and on the following day,
Prevented that a long fast in the end did not do so much
Let them go there to exercise their talent.
I conclude from this adventure,
That it doesn't take so much art to keep your days,
And thanks to the gifts of Nature,
The hand is the safest and quickest rescue.
