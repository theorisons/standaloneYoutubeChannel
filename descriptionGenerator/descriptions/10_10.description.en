The Pisces and the Shepherd playing the flute | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 10 Fable 10

___

Tircis, who for the only Annette
Ringing the chords
With a voice and a musette
Capable of touching the death,
One day sang along the edges
From a wave watering meadows,
Zéphyr lived in the flowery countryside.
Annette, however, was fishing;
But no fish approached;
The Shepherd was losing her pain.
The Shepherd, who, by his songs,
Had it attracted the inhumans,
Raw, and thought wrong, lure fish.
He sang to them this: “Citizens of this wave,
Leave your Naiad in its deep cave.
Come and see an object a thousand times more charming.
Do not be afraid to enter the prisons of Beauty.
It's only us that she's cruel.
You will be treated softly,
We don't want your life.
A pond awaits you, clearer than fine crystal;
And, when to a few the bait would be fatal,
Dying with Annette's hands is a spell I envy.”
This eloquent speech did not make much effect;
The audience was deaf as well as mute:
Although Tircis preached. His honeyed words
Having gone to the winds,
He stretched out a long ret. Here are the fish caught;
Here are the fish at the foot of the Bergère.
O you, shepherds of humans and not sheep;
Kings, who believe to win by reason the spirits
From a multitude of foreigns,
That is never the way we get to grips with it;
There needs to be another way:
Use your rets, power does everything.
