The Snake and the Lime | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 5 Fable 16

___

It is said that a Serpent, neighbor of a watchmaker
(It was for the watchmaker a bad neighborhood),
Entered his shop, and, seeking to eat,
N'met there for any soup
That a Steel File he began to gnaw.
This Lime says to her, without getting angry:
“Poor ignorant! eh! What do you pretend to do?
You're getting harder than you.
Little Crazy Head Snake:
Rather than taking away from me
Only a quarter of a obole,
You'd break all your teeth.
I fear only those of time.”
This is addressed to you, spirits of the last order,
Who, being good for nothing, seek on everything to bite.
You torment yourself in vain.
Do you think your teeth are printing their insults?
On so many beautiful works?
They are for you brass, steel, diamond.
