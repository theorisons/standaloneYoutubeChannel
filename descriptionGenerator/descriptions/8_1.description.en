Death and the Dying | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 8 Fable 1

___

Death does not surprise the wise:
He's always ready to leave,
Having been able to warn himself
The time when we must resolve ourselves to this passage.
This time, alas! embraces all the time:
Share it in days, hours, moments,
It is not that he does not understand
In the fatal tribute; all of them are in his domain;
And the first moment when the children of kings
Open your eyes to the light,
Is the one who sometimes comes
Close forever their eyelid.
Defend yourself by greatness;
Allegate beauty, virtue, youth;
Death delights everything without modesty:
One day the whole world will increase its wealth.
It is nothing less ignored;
And since I have to say it,
Nothing where you're less prepared.
A Dying, who had more than a hundred years of life,
Complained to Death that hastily
She forced him to leave just a while.
Without him having made his testament,
Without warning him at least. “Is it fair that we die?
With your feet up? he said; wait a little;
My wife doesn't want me to leave without her;
I still have to provide a great-nephew;
Suffer that I add another wing to my house.
How urgent you are, O cruel goddess!
“Old man, “said death to him, “I did not surprise you.
You complain for no reason about my impatience:
Hey! Are you not a hundred years old? Find me in Paris
Two mortals as old; find me ten in France.
I had to give you some advice.
Who disposed you to the thing:
I would have found your will,
Your grandson, your perfect building.
Wouldn't we give you advice, when the cause
Walking and movement,
When the spirits, the feeling,
When everything collapsed in you? More taste, more hearing;
Everything to you seems to be fainted;
For you the star of the day takes superfluous care:
You regret things that don't touch you anymore.
I made you see your comrades.
Or dead, or dying, or sick;
What is all this, that a warning?
Come on, old man, and no reply.
It matters to the republic
That you make your will.”
Death was right: I wish that at this age
We came out of life and from a banquet,
Thanking his host; and that they made his package:
Because how much can we delay the trip?
You whisper, old man; see these young people die.
See them walking, see them running
To the dead, it is true, glorious and beautiful,
But safe, and sometimes cruel.
I may shout to you, but my zeal is indiscreet:
The most similar to the dead dies most with regret.
