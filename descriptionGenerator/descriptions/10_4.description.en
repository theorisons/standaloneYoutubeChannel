The Buryman and his Comper | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 10 Fable 4

___

A mesh clip had amassed so much
That he didn't know where to house his finance.
The avarice, companion and sister of ignorance,
made him very embarrassed
In the choice of a custodian;
For he wanted one, and this is his reason:
“The object tempts; this heap must be altered.
If I leave it at home:
I will be the thief myself of my own good.
- The thief? What? to enjoy is to steal oneself!
My friend, I have mercy on your extreme mistake;
Learn from me this lesson:
The good is good only as one can get it out;
Without it, it's an evil. Do you want to book it
For an age and times that have nothing to do with?
The trouble of acquiring, the care of preservation,
Take away the price from gold, which we believe is necessary.”
To discharge such care,
Our man could have found safe people if needed.
He loved the earth better; and taking his companion
This one helps her. They're gonna bury the treasure.
After some time the man will see his gold;
He found only the lodging.
Rightly suspicion of the fellow, he goes fast
Say to him, “Get ready; for I still have left
A few deniers: I want to join them with the other mass.”
The companus immediately will put back in his place
The stolen money, pretending well
Take everything back at once without anything missing.
But for this one, the other was wise:
He kept everything at home, determined to enjoy.
No more piling, no more burying;
And the poor thief, no longer finding his stage,
Thought to fall from his height.
It is not difficult to deceive a deceiver.
