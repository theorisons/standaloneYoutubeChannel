The Fox and the Chickens of India | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 12 Fable 18

___

Against the Assaults of a Fox
A turkey tree was used as a citadel.
The treacherous having gone all the way around the rampart,
And seeing each one as a sentinel,
“What!” cried out, “What! these people will laugh at me!
Only they will be exempt from the common law!
No, by all the Gods, no.” He fulfils his saying.
The moon, then shining, seemed against the Sire
Wanting to favour the turkey maker.
He, who was not a novice to the profession of besieging
He resorted to his sack of villains tricks,
Feignit wanting to climb, is guinda on his patts,
Then counterfeited the dead, then the risen one.
Harlequin would not have executed
So many different characters.
He raised his cock, he made it shine.,
And a hundred thousand other snooks.
During which no turkey would have dared to sleep
The enemy weary them by holding their sight
On the same object always tense.
The poor people being dazzled over the long time,
Always someone fell out of it: so many taken
So many apart: almost half succumbs.
The companion carries them in his pantry.
The too much attention we have for danger
Most often we fall into it.
