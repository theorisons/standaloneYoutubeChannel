The Danube Peasant | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 11 Fable 7

___

People should not be judged on appearance.
The council is good; but it is not new.
Once the error of the Souriceau
I used to prove my speech:
I have, to found it now,
The good Socrates, Aessop, and certain peasant
From the banks of the Danube, a man whose Marc-Aurelius
Made us a very faithful portrait.
We know the first: as for the other, here is
The character shortcut.
His chin fed a bushy beard;
His whole hairy person
Represented a bear, but a badly licked bear:
Under a thick eyebrow he had a hidden eyebrow.
The crooked look, twisted nose, big lip,
Wearing sayon of goat hair,
And belt of marine rushes.
This man so built was a deputy for the cities
What washes the Danube. There were no asylums
Where the greed of the Romans
Then did not penetrate, and bore hands.
So the hon. member came, and made this harangue:
“Romans, and you, Senate, sitting to listen to me,
First of all, I beg the Gods to assist me:
Will the Immortals, drivers of my tongue,
Let me not say anything that should be taken back!
Without their help, he cannot enter the minds
Let all evil and injustice:
Failure to resort to them is violating their laws.
Witness to us that Roman greed punishes:
Rome is, by our packages, more than by its exploites,
The instrument of our torment.
Fear, Romans, fear that Heaven someday
Do not carry home weeping and misering,
And putting in our hands, by a just return,
The weapons used by his harsh revenge,
He does not make you, in his anger.
Our slaves in turn.
And why are we yours? Let me be told
How you are better than a hundred different peoples.
What right has made you masters of the Universe?
Why come to disturb an innocent life?
We cultivated in peace happy fields; and our hands
Were specific to the arts, as well as to ploughing.
What did you learn to the Germans?
They have the skill and courage:
If they had greed...
Like you, and violence,
Maybe in your place they would have the power,
And would be able to use it without inhumanity.
The one your lenders have on us exercised
Only barely enters into thought.
The majesty of your altars
She herself is offended;
For know that the Immortals
Have eyes on us. Thanks to your examples,
They only have objects of horror before their eyes.
In contempt of them, and of their temples,
Of greed that goes to fury.
Nothing is enough for the people who come to us from Rome:
The land and the work of man
Do to satisfy them unnecessary efforts.
Remove them: we don't want to anymore
To cultivate the countryside for them;
We leave the cities, we flee to the mountains;
We leave our dear companions;
We only talk with dreadful bears,
Discouraged to bring to light unfortunate,
And to populate for Rome a country she oppresses.
As for our children already born,
We wish to see their days soon stubborn:
Your lenders to misfortune make us join the crime.
Remove them: they won't teach us
That softness and vice;
Germans like them will become
People of rapine and greed.
That's all I saw in Rome at first.
Is it not now to do,
No purple to give? it is in vain that we hope
Some refuge to the laws: still their ministry
Did he have a thousand lengths. This speech, a little loud,
Must begin to displease you.
I'm finished. Punish with death
A little too sincere complaint.”
At these words, he lies down: and everyone amazed
Admire the big heart, common sense, eloquence,
From the savage so prostrated.
He was created as a patrice; and it was revenge
It was believed that such a speech deserved. We choose
Other lenders; and in writing
The Senate asked what this man had said,
To serve as a model for future speakers.
We didn't know long in Rome
This eloquence maintain.
