The Devineresses | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 7 Fable 15

___

It is often by chance that opinion,
And it is the opinion that is always in vogue.
I could found this prologue
On people of all states: everything is prevention,
Cabal, stubbornness; no or little justice:
It's a torrent; what to do there? He must have his class:
It was and will always be.
A woman in Paris made the pythonisse:
He was going to be consulted on each event;
We lost a rag, we had a lover,
A husband living too much to his woman,
An unfortunate mother, a jealous woman;
At the Guesser we raced,
To be announced what we wanted.
His fact consisted of address:
A few terms of art, a lot of boldness,
Occasionally, all of this was contributing to,
All this often made a miracle shout.
Finally, although ignorant at 21 carats,
She thought she was an oracle.
The oracle was housed in a galetas:
There, this woman fills her scholarship.
And, without any other resource,
Earns enough to give a rank to her husband;
She buys an office, a house, too.
Here is the full galetas
From a new hostess, to whom the whole city,
Women, girls, jacks, fat gentlemen, all finally,
Wanted, as in the past, to ask for his destiny;
The galetas became the lair of the Sibyl.
The other female had ridled this place.
This woman, though she did, even though she says,
“Guess me! we mock: eh! gentlemen, can I read?
I have never learned but my cross from God.”
Point of reason: it was necessary to guess and predict,
Aside from force good ducats,
And win in spite of itself more than two lawyers.
The furniture and the crew were very helpful in the thing:
Four lame seats, one brush handle,
Everything felt his sabbath and his metamorphosis.
When that woman would have said true
In a upholstered room,
We would have laughed at it: the vogue had passed
At the galetas; he had the credit.
The other woman mop.
The sign makes the trade.
I saw in the palace a misplaced dress
Winning big: people had taken it
For such master, who dragged after himself
Strength listening. Ask me why.
