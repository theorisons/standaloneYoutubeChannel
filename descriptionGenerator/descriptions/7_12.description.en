The Man who runs after Fortune and the Man who awaits him in bed | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 7 Fable 12

___

Who does not run after Fortune?
I would like to be where I could easily
Behold the unwelcome crowd
Of those who seek in vain
This daughter of fate, from kingdom to kingdom,
Faithful courtiers of a phantom flock.
When they're close to the right time,
The inconstant immediately to their desires escapes.
Poor people! I pity them; for we have for the fools
More pity than wrath.
“This man, they say, was a cabbage planter;
And now he has become pope!
Aren't we worth it? ” You're worth a hundred times better:
But what does your merit do to you?
Does Fortune have eyes?
And then is the papacy worth what we leave,
Rest? Rest, treasure so precious
That it used to be shared with the Gods?
Rarely Fortune to its hosts leaves him.
Look not for this Deesse,
She will look for you; her sex wears it so.
Some couple of friends, in an established village
Possessed some property. One was constantly sighing
For Fortune, he said to the other one day:
“If we leave our stay?
You know that no one is a prophet
In his country: let's look for our adventure elsewhere.
“Seek, “said the other friend. “For me, I do not wish
No better climates or destinies.
Be content, follow your worrying mood:
You'll be back soon. I wish, however,
To sleep while waiting for you.”
The ambitious, or, if you want, miser,
Goes away by road and by road.
He arrived the next day
In a place that the bizarre goddess owed
To frequent on any other; and this place is the court.
There so for some time he fixed his stay,
Being at bedtime, at sunrise, at these hours
That we know to be the best;
Anyway, being at everything, and coming to nothing.
“What is this? he said to himself, let us look elsewhere for good.
Fortune, however, lives in these mansions;
I see her coming into this house every day,
At this one: where does it come from
Can't I house this capricious?
I was told that people from this place
You don't always like the ambitious mood.
Farewell, gentlemen of court; gentlemen of court, farewell:
Follow to the end a shadow that flatters you.
Fortune has, it is said, temples in Surat;
Let's go there.” It was one to say and embark.
Bronze souls, human, that one was no doubt
Armed with diamond, who tried this road,
And the first dared the abyss to challenge.
The latter, during his journey,
Turning his eyes to his village
More than once, wiping the dangers
Pirates, winds, calm and rocks,
Ministers of Death: with great sorrow
We're going to fetch it from the far shorels,
Finding her early enough without leaving the house.
Man arrives at Mogol; he is told that in Japan
Fortune for then distributed its graces.
He runs there. The seas were tired
To bear it; and all the fruit
That he drew from his long journey,
It was this lesson that the savages give:
“Dwell in thy land by the educated nature.”
Japan was no happier to this man
That the Mogol had been:
Which made him conclude in the sleep,
That he had wrongfully left his village.
He renounces ungrateful races,
Returning to his country, seeing from afar his penals,
Weeping with joy, and said, “Blessed who lives in his own home,
To settle his desires doing all his job!
He knows only by hearsay
What the court, the sea and your empire,
Fortune, which makes us pass before our eyes
Dignity, goods that all the way to the end of the world
We follow, without the effect of promises answering.
From now on I will not move, and will do a hundred times better.”
In reasoning of this fate,
And against Fortune having taken this advice,
He finds her sitting at the door
From his friend plunged into a deep sleep.
