Democritans and the Abderitans | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 8 Fable 26

___

That I've always hated the thoughts of the vulgar!
That it seems to me profane, unjust, and reckless.
Putting false circles between the thing and him,
And measuring for himself what he sees in others!
The master of Epicurus made the apprenticeship.
His country thought he was crazy. Little spirits! But what?
No one is a prophet at home.
These people were the fools, Democritus, the wise man.
The mistake went so far that Abdère deputies
Towards Hippocrates, and the invitation,
By letters and embassy,
Coming to restore the reason of the patient.
“Our fellow citizen,” they said in weep,
Loses mind: reading has spoiled Democritus.
We'd value him more if he were ignorant.
“No number,” he said, “the worlds limit:
“Maybe even they are filled
“Infinite Democrits.”
Not content with this dream, he joins atoms to it,
Children of a hollow brain, invisible ghosts;
And measuring the heavens without moving from here,
He knows the Universe, and he doesn't know himself.
A time was when he knew how to tune the debates:
Now he's talking to himself.
Come, divine mortal; his madness is extreme.”
Hippocrates did not have too much faith in these people;
However, he left. And see, I beg you,
What encounters in life
The spell causes! Hippocrates arrived in time
That whoever was said to be right or meaningless
Seeking in man and in beast
Which seat has the reason, either the heart or the head.
Under a thick shade, sitting near a stream,
The mazes of a brain
occupied him. He had at his feet a lot of volume,
And almost did not see his friend advancing forward,
Attached according to his custom.
Their compliment was short, as one might think:
The wise man is saving time and words.
Having therefore set aside the frivolous interviews,
And much reasoned about man and spirit;
They fell on morals.
There's no need for me to spread
Everything that both of them say.
The previous narrative suffices
To show that the people are reputable.
In what sense is true
What I read in some place,
That his voice is the voice of God?
