Tribubut sent by animals to Alexandre | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 4 Fable 12

___

A fable was running among antiquity,
And the reason is not known to me.
Let the reader draw a morality.
Here is the naked fable:
The Fame having said in a hundred places
That a son of Jupiter, a certain Alexander,
Wanting to leave nothing free under the heaven,
Commanded that, without further wait,
Every people at his feet went to surrender;
Quadrupeds, humans, elephants, worms,
The bird republics;
The Goddess with a hundred mouths, tell me.
Having put terror everywhere
By publishing the decree of the new emperor,
Animals, and any kind lige
With his only appetite, believed that this time
We had to undergo other laws.
We gather in the desert. All of them leave their den.
After various opinions, we solve, we conclude
To send tribute and tribute.
For the tribute and for the manner,
The Monkey was charged with it: it was written to him
What we wanted was said.
The only tribute held them in trouble.
Because what to give? it needed money.
We took it from a compelling prince.
Who owns in his field
Gold mines, provide what we wanted.
As there was a question of bearing this tribution,
The Mullet and the Donkey offered oneself,
Assisted by the Horse and the Camel.
All four on their way, they started.
With the Monkey, new ambassador.
The caravan finally meets in a passage
Monsignor the Lion: they did not like it.
“We meet every time.
He said, and here we are traveling companions.
I was going to offer my fact apart;
But, although it is light, I am embarrassed by any burden.
Forget me to give me grace
Than to wear each a quarter:
It won't be too big a load for you,
And I'll be freer and much more in condition,
In case the thieves attack our tape,
And let us come to battle.”
Leading a Lion is rarely practiced.
So he is admitted, relieved, well received.
And, despite the hero of Jupiter out,
Making expensive and living on the public stock exchange.
They arrived in a meadow
All bordered by streams, flowers,
Where many sheep sought his life;
Stay of the fresh, true part
Zephirs. The Lion was not there, only to these people
He complained of being sick.
“Continue your embassy,
He said, “I feel a fire burning me in the slight,
And want to look here for some salutary grass.
Do not waste time for you:
Give me back my money, I can deal with it.
We unpack; and first the Lion cries out,
In a tone that testified to his joy:
“How many daughters, O Gods, my coins
Have produced! See; most of them are already
As big as their mothers.
It belongs to me.” He took all of this.
Or if he did not take everything, he was not healed.
The Monkey and the confused bed steams,
Without daring to replicate, on the way recovered.
The son of Jupiter is told that they complained.
And had no reason.
What would he have done? It would have been lion against lion;
And the saying says, Corsairs to Corsaires,
The other attacking, don't do their business.
