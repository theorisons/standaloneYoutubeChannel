The Donkey and the Dog | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 8 Fable 17

___

We have to help each other, it's the law of nature.
The donkey one day, however, laughed at it:
And do not know how lacking it was;
Because he's a good creature.
He went by country, accompanied by the Dog,
Seriously, without thinking about anything;
Both followed by a common master.
This master fell asleep. The donkey began to graze:
He was then in a meadow
Whose grass was strong at his will.
But there was no thistle; for the time being it:
It is not always necessary to be so delicate;
And, failing to serve this dish,
Rarely a feast remains.
Our baudet finally found out
Pass this time. The Dog, Dying of Hunger
Said to him, “Dear companion, lower down, I pray thee:
I'll have dinner in the bread basket.”
Answer point, word; the Roussin of Arcadia
Feared that by losing a moment,
He did not lose a tooth.
He made a deaf ear for a long time:
Finally he replied, “Friend, I advise you
To wait until your master has finished his sleep;
For he will give you without fail, when he wakes up,
Your accustomed portion:
It cannot be long.”
On these interlude a Wolf
Get out of the wood, and come: another hungry beast.
The Donkey immediately calls the Dog to help him.
The Dog does not move, and says, “Friend, I advise you
To flee until your master awakens;
He could not delay: detach quickly, and run.
If this Wolf reaches you, break his jaw.
You have been shot nine, and if you will believe me,
Thou shalt lay it flat.” In this beautiful speech,
Lord Wolf strangled the Baudet without a cure.
I conclude that we need to help each other.
