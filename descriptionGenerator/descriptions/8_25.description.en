The Two Dogs and the Dead Donkey | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 8 Fable 25

___

The virtues should be sisters,
And the vices are brothers.
As soon as one of them takes over our hearts,
All come to the queue; there is no need for healing:
I hear from those who, not being contrary,
Can be housed under the same roof.
With regard to virtues, rarely we see them
All in one eminently placed subject
Hold by hand without being scattered.
One is valiant, but speedy; the other is cautious.
[but cold.
Among the animals, the Dog stings itself to be
Careful and faithful to his master;
But he's foolish, he's greedy:
Witness these two mastines who, in the remoten,
A dead donkey was floating on the airwaves.
The wind more and more kept him away from our Dogs.
“Friend, “said one, “your eyes are better than mine:
Look a little at these deep plains;
I think I can see something. Is it an ox, a horse?
“Eh!” what does any animal?
One of these mastines said; this is always a priest.
The point is to have it; for the journey is great;
And we have to swim against the wind.
Let's drink all that water; our throat is altered
It will come to an end: this body will remain
Soon dry, and it will be
Provision for the week.”
These are my dogs to drink; they lost breath.
And then life; they did so much
Let us see them die right now.
Man is thus built: when a subject inflames him;
Impossibility disappears to his soul.
How many wishes he makes, how many steps,
Outraged to acquire property or glory!
If I rounded up my state!
If I could fill my chests with ducats!
If I learned Hebrew, science, history!
All this is the sea to drink;
But nothing for man is enough.
To provide projects that form a single mind,
It would take four bodies; yet, far from sufficing,
Halfway I believe that all would remain:
Four Mathusalems end-to-end could not
Put an end to what one wants.
