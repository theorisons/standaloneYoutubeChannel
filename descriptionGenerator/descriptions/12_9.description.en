The Wolf and the Fox | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 12 Fable 9

___

Where does no one in life come from
Is not satisfied with his condition?
Such would like to be a soldier
To whom the soldier wants.
Some Fox wanted, said,
Make a wolf. Hey! that can say
Than for sheep's craft
No wolf ever sighs?
What amazes me is that at age eight
A prince in fable put the thing,
While under my white hair
I make by time
Worms less sensible than her prose.
The strokes in his fable sown
Are not in the work of the poet
Neither all nor so well expressed:
His praise is more complete.
To sing it on the muzzle,
It's my talent, but I expect
That my hero, in a short time,
Will make me take the trumpet.
I am not a great prophet:
But I read in the heavens
That soon his glorious facts
Will ask for several Homers;
And this time does not produce heals.
Leaving aside all these mysteries,
Let's try to tell the fable successfully.
The Fox said to the Wolf: “Our dear, for all food
I often have an old rooster, or skinny chickens:
It's a meat that gets tired of me.
You make better expensive with less chance:
I'm approaching the houses; you're keeping away.
Teach me your profession, comrade, by grace;
Give me the first of my race
Who supplies his fang of some fat sheep:
Thou shalt not put me among the ungrateful.
“I want it, “said the Wolf. “A brother of mine died to me.
Let's take his skin, you'll put on it.”
He came, and the Wolf said, “Here is how it is to do,
If you want to keep the mastids out of the flock.”
The Fox, having put the skin,
Repeated the lessons his master gave him.
First he went wrong, then a little better, then well.
Then at last there was nothing missing.
He was barely educated as much as he could be,
Let a flock come near. The new wolf runs there
And spread terror in the places around.
Tel, dressed in the weapons of Achille,
Patrocle set the alarm in the camp and in the city:
Mothers, dawned and old men, to the temple all ran.
The ost to the bleating people believed to see fifty wolves:
Dog, shepherd, and flock, all fled to the village,
And leave only one sheep for pledge.
The thief grabs it. A few steps away
He heard a cock singing from the neighborhood.
The disciple immediately right to the rooster goes away.
Throwing down his class dress,
Forgetting the sheep, the lessons, the regent,
And running a diligent step.
What's the point of countering each other?
To pretend to change this way is an illusion:
We take back his first trace
At the first opportunity.
Of your mind, let no one else equals,
Prince, my Muse is holding this whole project:
You gave me the topic,
Dialogue, and morality.
