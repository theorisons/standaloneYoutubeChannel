Wishes | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 7 Fable 6

___

He's at the Mogol des follets
Who act as valets,
Hold the house clean, take care of the crew,
And sometimes gardening.
If you touch their work,
You spoil everything. One of them near the Ganges once
Growing the garden of a pretty good bourgeois.
He worked without noise, had a lot of addresses,
Loved the master and the mistress,
And the garden especially. God knows if the Zephyrs,
People, friends of the Demon, assisted him in his task!
The follet, on his part, working tireless,
Fills its guests with pleasures.
For more marks of his zealy,
In these people for ever he had stopped,
Notwithstanding the lightness
To its similarly natural;
But his confreres the spirits
So long as the head of this republic,
By whim or by policy,
Soon he changed his home.
Order him just went to the bottom of Norway
Taking care of a home
At all times covered with snow;
And from Hindou that he was we do it to you Lappon.
Before leaving, the spirit says to its hosts:
“I am forced to leave you;
I don't know for what mistakes:
But finally we have to. I can't stop
Only a short time, a month, maybe a week:
Use it; form three wishes: for I can
Make three wishes fulfilled;
Three, no more.” Wishing is not a penalty
Strange and new to humans.
These, for the first wish, demand abundance;
And Abundance in hands,
Pour the finance,
In their barns the wheat, in their cellars the wines;
Everything is dying. How to put this chevance away?
What records, what care, what time it took for them!
Both of them are prevented if we ever were.
The thieves against them plotted;
The great lords borrowed from them.
The prince taxed them. These are the poor people
Unhappy by too much fortune.
“Remove us from these goods the unwelcome influence,
They said, “Blessed are the needy.”
Poverty is better than such wealth.
Get away, treasures; flee: and thou, god,
Mother of good spirit, companion of rest,
O mediocrity, come back quickly.” To these words
Mediocrity returns; it is replaced:
With her they come back in grace,
After two wishes being so lucky
That they were, and what are all those
Who always wish and lose in chimera
The time they'd better put on their business.
The follet laughs with them.
To take advantage of its wide,
When he wanted to leave and was on the point,
They asked for Wisdom:
It is a treasure that does not embarrass.
