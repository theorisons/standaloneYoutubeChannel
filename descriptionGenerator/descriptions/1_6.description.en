The Heifer, the Goat and the Sheep in partnership with the Lion | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 1 Fable 6

___

The Heifer, the Goat, and their sister the Sheep.
With a proud Lion, Lord of the Neighbourhood
It is said that, in the time of yet,
And pooled the gain and the damage.
In the lakes of the Goat a deer was caught.
To her associates as soon as she sends.
They came, the Lion by his fingernails,
And said, Four of us share the prey;
Then in as many parts the Deer he portrayed:
Took for him the first as Sire;
It must be mine, he said; and the reason,
It's because my name is Lion,
To this we have nothing to say.
The second by right must die encor:
This right, as you know, is the right of the strongest.
As the most valiant I pretend the third.
If anyone touches you to the fourth
I'll strangle him first.
