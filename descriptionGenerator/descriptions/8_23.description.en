The Torrent and the River | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 8 Fable 23

___

With big noise and big buzz
A stream fell from the mountains:
All fled before him; horror followed his footsteps.
He was shaking the countryside.
No traveler dared to pass
A barrier so powerful;
Only one saw thieves; and feeling squeezed;
He put this threatening wave between them and him.
It was only threat and noise without depth:
Our man finally had only fear.
This success courageous courage,
And the same thieves always chasing him
He met in his passage
A river whose course
Image of a gentle, peaceful, and quiet sleep,
First made him believe this very easy route:
Point of steep edges, pure and clean sand.
He enters; and his horse puts him
Covered for thieves, but not for the black wave:
Both to the Styx went to drink;
Both of them, swimming unfortunate,
They went to cross, to the darkness of the living,
Many rivers other than ours.
People without noise are dangerous:
That is not the case with others.
