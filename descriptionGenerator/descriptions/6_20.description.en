Discord | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 6 Fable 20

___

The Goddess Discord having blurred the God,
And made a big lawsuit up there for an apple,
They had her dislodged from the heavens.
In the animal called man
It was received with open arms.
She and what-if not, her brother,
With Tien-and-Mine, his father.
She honoured us in this low universe
To prefer our hemisphere
To that of mortals who are opposed to us,
Rude, uncivilized people,
And who, marrying without a priest and without a notary,
Discord have nothing to do.
To make it find in places where the need is
Requested that she be present,
The Fame had the care
To warn him; and the other, diligent,
Crused quickly to debates, and warned Peace;
It made a spark a long fire to extinguish.
Fame finally began to complain
That they never found him
Fixed and certain abode;
Often one lost, looking for her, her pain:
She therefore had to have an affected stay,
A stay from which we could in all families
Send it updated stopped.
Since there was no girls' convent at that time
There was difficulty.
The inn finally of the hymenÃ©e
He was for a house assigned to him.
