The Companions of Ulysses | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 12 Fable 1

___

To Monsignor The Duke of Burgundy
Prince, the sole object of the care of the Immortels,
Suffer that my incense perfumes your altars.
I offer you a little late these gifts from my Muse;
The years and the work will serve as an excuse for me:
My mind diminishes, instead of every moment
You can see yours going by increasing:
He does not go; he runs, he seems to have wings.
The hero from whom he holds such beautiful qualities
In the profession of Mars burns to do the same:
It does not care to him that, forcing victory,
It does not work by leaps and bounds
In the career of glory.
Some god holds him: he is our Sovereign.
He that a month made master and winner of the Rhine.
This speed was necessary at that time;
Perhaps she would be reckless today.
I'm not talking about it; both the Risks and the Loves
Are not suspected of loving long speeches.
Of these kinds of gods your court consists of:
They do not leave you. It's not just after all
Other gods do not hold the high end:
Sense and Reason regulate everything.
Consult the latter about a fact in which the Greeks
Reckless and uncircumstances,
surrendered themselves to charms
Who transformed humans into beasts.
The Companions of Ulysses, after ten years of alarms,
Wander at the wind, at their uncertain fate.
They approached a shoreline
Where the daughter of the God of the day,
Circe, then held his Court.
She had them get a drink
Delicious, but full of a deadly poison.
First they lose reason;
A few moments after their body and face
Take air and different animal traits:
They have become bears, lions, elephants;
Some under a huge mass,
Others in another form:
He saw small ones; exemplum, ut talpa.
The only Ulysses escaped.
He was able to challenge himself with the treacherous liquor.
As he joined wisdom
The mine of a hero and the gentle maintenance,
He did so much that the enchantess
Took another poison little different from his.
A goddess says everything she has in her soul:
She declared her flame.
Ulysses was too thin not to enjoy
From such a situation:
He obtained that these Greeks would be returned to their faces.
“But will they like it, “said the Nymph, “accept it?
Go and offer him this step to the troop.”
Ulysses runs there, and says, “The poisonous cutter
To his remedy again; and I come to offer it to you:
Dear friends, do you want to be men again?
We're already giving you the floor.”
The Lion says, thinking he roars:
“My head is not so crazy;
Do I give up the gifts I just acquired?
I have a claw and a tooth, and put in pieces that attack me.
I am king: shall I become a city dweller of Ithaca?
Maybe you'll make me simple soldier again.
I don't want to change my state.”
Lion Ulysses runs to the Bear: “Hey! my brother,
How you're done! I saw you so pretty!
“Ah!” really here we are!
Resumed the Bear in his own way.
How I am done! like a bear must be.
Who told you that one form is more beautiful than another?
Is it yours to judge ours?
I refer to the eyes of a bear my love.
Did I dislike you? Go away, follow your way and leave me.
I live free, happy, without any care that hurts me;
And tell you everything neat and dish:
I don't want to change my state.”
The Greek Prince to the Wolf will propose the affair;
He said to her, at random of a similar refusal:
“Comrade, I'm confused
That a young and beautiful shepherdess
Tale with echoes of gluttony appetites
That made you eat his sheep.
In the past you would have been seen saving his sheepfold:
You were leading an honest life.
Leave these woods, and become again.
Instead of wolf, good man.
“Is it?” said the Wolf: I do not see any of them for me.
You come to call me a carnival beast;
You talking, what are you? Would you not have, without me,
Eating these animals that the whole village complains?
If I were a man, by your faith,
Would I like carnage less?
For a word sometimes you all strangle yourself:
Aren't you two wolves?
All things considered, I support you in sum
That, scoundrel for scoundre,
It's better to be a wolf than a man:
I don't want to change my state.”
Ulysses gave one warning to all:
Each of them even answered.
Both the big and the small.
Freedom, woods, follow their appetite,
It was their supreme delights;
All of them renounced the Laws of Beautiful deeds.
They thought they were free, following their passions:
They were slaves to themselves.
Prince, I wish I'd picked you a subject
Where I could mix the pleasurable with the useful:
It was probably a nice project
If that choice would have been easy.
The Companions of Ulysses finally offered themselves;
They have the same strength in this lower universe:
People I impose on for pain
Your censorship and your hatred.
