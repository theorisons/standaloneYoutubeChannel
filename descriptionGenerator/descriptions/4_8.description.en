The Man and the Wood Idol | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 4 Fable 8

___

Some Gentile in his house kept a wooden god,
Of those gods who are deaf, though having ears.
The pagan, however, promised himself wonders.
It cost him as much as three.
They were only vows and offers,
Sacrifices of oxen crowned with garlands.
Never idol, whoever he be,
Had not had so greasy cook,
For all this worship, it was not possible for his host to be
Succession, treasure, gambling gain, no grace.
Much more, if for a storm penny somewhere
Pamping of one kind or other,
Man had his share, and his purse suffered.
The pitance of God was nevertheless strong.
In the end, getting angry about getting nothings,
He takes you a lever, puts the Idole,
He finds him full of gold: “When I did you good,
Did you get me, he said, only one obole?
Go, get out of my house, look for other altars.
You look like naturals
Unhappy, rude and stupid:
You can't get anything out of it except with the stick.
The more I filled you, the emptiest my hands were:
I did right to change my tone.”
