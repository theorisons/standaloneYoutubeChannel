The Eagle, the Laie and the Pussy | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 3 Fable 6

___

The Eagle had its young at the top of a hollow tree.
The Laie on the foot, the Pussy in between;
And without any inconvenience, with this share,
Mothers and infants were toddling.
The Pussy destroyed the agreement by her deceitful.
She climbed to the Eagle, and said, “Our death
(At least of our children, because it's all one to mothers)
Will not delay possible heals.
Do you see at our feet snooping incessantly
That damn Laie, and digging a mine?
It's to uproot the oak surely,
And from our infants attract ruin.
As the tree falls, they will be devoured:
Let them stand as insured.
If I had one left, I would soften my complaint.”
From that place, which it fills with fear,
The treacherous goes straight down
In the place
Where the Laie was in gerine.
“My good friend and my neighbor, 103
She said to her very low, I give you an opinion:
The Eagle, if you go out, will melt on your little ones:
Make me not to say anything about it;
His wrath would fall upon me.”
In this other family that has sown the dread,
The pussy in her hole is retiring.
The Eagle does not dare to go out, nor to provide for the needs
Of its little ones; the Laie even less:
Fool not to see that the greatest of care,
It must be the one to avoid starvation.
To stay at home, both persists
To rescue his own in the opportunity:
The royal bird, in case of mine,
The Laie, in case of burst.
Hunger destroyed everything: no one remained.
Marcasine and eagglonne,
Who did not go from life to death:
Great backup for gentlemen Cats.
What does not know how to dare a treacherous tongue
By his pernicious address!
Of the misfortunes that came out 104
From the box of Pandore,
The one that the whole Universe abhors,
It's the deceit, in my opinion.
