The Sick Deer | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 12 Fable 6

___

In a country full of deer, a deer fell ill.
Incontinent many comrade
Rush to his grabat see him, rescue him.
To comfort him at least: unwelcome multitude.
“Eh! gentlemen, let me die:
Allow that in common form
The Park sends me away, and finish your crying.”
Point at all: The Comforters
This sad duty throughout the length,
When he pleased God went away:
It wasn't without a drink.
That is, without taking a grazing right.
Everything began to graze the woods of the neighborhood.
The pitance of the Deer fell by many;
He found nothing more to fry:
From evil he fell into a worst.
And is seen reduced to the end
To fast and starve.
It costs whoever is calling you,
Physicians of the body and soul.
O time, O morals! I'm shouting,
Everybody gets paid.
