The Bear and the Two Companions | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 5 Fable 20

___

Two companions in a hurry of money,
To their neighbor furrier sold
The skin of a still alive bear,
But that they would kill soon; at least as they said.
He was the King of the Bear on account of these people.
The merchant in his skin had to make a fortune;
It would guarantee the most hot colds;
We could stuff two dresses rather than one.
Dindenaut took less of his sheep than their bears:
Their, on their own account, not on the beast's.
By offering to deliver it no later than two days,
They agree on prices, and they are in question,
Find the Bear that advances and comes to them by trotting.
These are my people hit like at first sight.
The market did not keep; it had to be solved:
Interest against the Bear, we don't say a word.
One of the two companions climbs to the top of a tree;
The other, colder than a marble,
Leth on his nose, makes death, holds his wind,
Having somewhere heard say
Let the bear fearless infrequently
On a body that does not live, move, or breathe.
Lord Bear, like a fool, gave in this panel:
He sees this body lying, thinks he's deprived of life,
And, for fear of deceit,
Turn him, turn him over, approach his muzzle,
Stink at the passages of breath.
“It is,” he said, “a corpse. Let us take off, for it smells.”
In these words, the Bear is going to the next forest.
One of our two merchants from his tree descends.
Shorts to his companion, tells him that it's marvellous
That he only had fear for all evil.
“Well, “he added, “the skin of the animal?
But what did he say to you?
For he was approaching very close,
Turning you with his greenhouse.
“He told me that you should never
Sell the skin of the bear until it was put on the ground.”
