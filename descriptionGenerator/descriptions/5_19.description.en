The Lion Going to War | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 5 Fable 19

___

The Lion in his head had a business:
He held a council of war, sent his provoks,
Fit warn the animals.
All of them were of purpose, each according to his own will:
The Elephant had to be on his back
Wear the necessary gear.
And fight at its ordinary;
The Bear, getting ready for the assaults;
The Fox, keeping secret practices,
And the Monkey, amuse the enemy by his tricks.
“Send back, “said someone, “the donkeys that are heavy.
And the hares, subject to panic terrors.
“No at all, “said the king, “I want to use them:
Our troop without them would not be complete.
The donkey will frighten people, serving us as a trumpet;
And the Hare can serve us as mail.”
The prudent and wise monarch
Of his slightest subjects knows how to make any use,
And knows the various talents.
There is nothing useless to people of senses.
