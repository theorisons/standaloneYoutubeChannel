The Horse wanting to avenge the Deer | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 4 Fable 13

___

Horses were never born for men.
When the human genus of glans was contact,
Donkey, horse, and mule, in the forests lived;
And it was not seen, as in the century in which we are,
So many stools and so many sticks,
So many harnoises for fighting,
So many chairs, so many coaches;
As it was also not seen
So many feasts and so many weddings.
Now, a Horse had a different
With a deer full of speed,
And, not being able to catch him by runing,
He resorted to the man, begged for his address.
The man put a brake on him, jumped on his back,
Give him no rest
Let the Deer not be taken, and let it live.
And that's done, the Horse thanks
Man his benefactor, saying, “I am yours;
Goodbye; I return to my wilderness stay.
“Not that, “said the Man. “It is better in us.
I see too much what your use is.
So abide; you will be well treated.
And to the belly in the litter box.”
Alas! what serves the good dear
When you don't have freedom?
The Horse realized that he had been madness;
But it was no longer time: already his stable
Was ready and all built.
He died there dragging his connection:
Wise if he would have delivered a slight offense.
Regardless of the pleasure of revenge,
It's buying it too expensive than buying it from a good
Without whom the others are nothing.
