The Young Widow | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 6 Fable 21

___

The loss of a husband is not without sighs:
We make a lot of noise, and then we console ourselves.
On the wings of Time sadness flies away;
Time brings back pleasures.
Between the Widow of a Year
And the Widow of a Day
The difference is great: one would never think
That it was the same person;
One makes people run away, and the other has a thousand attractions:
To true or false sighs this one abandons itself;
It's always the same note and the same interview.
They say we're inconsolable:
It is said; it is nothing,
As will be seen by this fable,
Or rather by the truth.
The husband of a young beauty
It was going to the other world. By his side his wife
He shouted, “Wait for me, I am with you; and my soul,
As well as yours, is ready to fly.”
The husband makes the trip alone.
The beautiful woman had a father, a prudent and wise man;
He let the torrent sink.
At the end, to comfort her:
“My daughter,” he said to her, “is too much tears:
What does the deceased need for you to drown your charms?
Since he is living, don't think of the dead anymore.
I'm not saying that earlier
A better condition
Change these transports into weddings;
But after some time suffer that you are offered
A beautiful husband, well done, young, and everything else
That the deceased. — Ah! she said,
A cloister is the husband I need.”
The father let him digest his disgrace.
A month like this happens;
The other month, we use it to change every day
Something about the dress, the laundry, the hairstyle:
Finally, mourning serves as an issue,
Waiting for other daughters.
The whole band of Love
Back to the dovecote; games, laughs, dancing
Also have their turn at the end:
We plunge in evening and morning
In the Fountain of Youth.
The father no longer feared this beloved deceased;
But since he didn't talk about anything to our beautiful woman:
“Where is the young husband
That you promised me? she said.
