The Old Man and the Three Young Men | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 11 Fable 8

___

An octogenarian planted.
“Pass again to build; but plant at this age! ”
Three young people, children of the neighborhood said:
Surely he was drooting.
“For in the name of the Gods, I pray you,
What fruit of this labour can you collect?
As much as a patriarch you'd have to grow old.
What's the point of charging your life
Care for a future that is not for you?
Now only think about your past mistakes;
Leave the long hope and vast thoughts;
All this is suitable only for us.
— It is not suitable for yourself,
The Old Man left. Any establishment
Come late, and lasts little. The hand of the Blue Parques
Your days and mine are also played.
Our terms are the same in their short duration.
Who of us from the clartés of the azurea vault
Must enjoy the last one? Is there no time
Who can assure you of a second only?
My great-nephews will owe me this shading:
Well! defend yourselves to the wise man
To give oneself care for the pleasure of others?
This very is a fruit that I taste today:
I can enjoy it tomorrow, and a few more days;
I can finally count the dawn
More than once on your tombs.”
The Old Man was right; one of the three Youth
Drowned from the port, going to America;
The other, in order to ascend to the great dignities,
In Mars jobs serving the Republic
By an unexpected blow lives his days washed away;
The third fell from a tree
That he himself wanted to enter;
And cried for the Old Man, he engraved on their marble
What I just told.
