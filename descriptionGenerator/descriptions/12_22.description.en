A Crazy and a Wise | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 12 Fable 22

___

Some Fool was chasing a wise man with stone blows.
And the wise man turned, and said unto him, My friend,
It is very well done to you; receive this one:
You're tired enough to earn more.
Any pain, it is said, is worthy of rent.
Look at this man passing by; he has enough to pay:
Ask him your gifts, they'll get their salary.
Initiated by the win our Crazy is going to make
Same insults to the other Bourgeois.
We didn't pay him in cash this time.
Mort Estafier rushes: we catch you our man,
We knock it on you, we knock it out.
To the Kings he is such fools.
At your expense they make the Master laugh.
To suppress their babble, will you go
Abuse them? You may not be
Pretty powerful. We need to hire them
To speak to whoever can take revenge.
