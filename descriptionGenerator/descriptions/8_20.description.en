Jupiter and the Thunderers | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 8 Fable 20

___

Jupiter seeing our fests,
One day said from the top of the air:
“Fill new hosts
The cantons of the Universe
Inhabited by this breed
That bothers me and gets tired.
Go, Mercury, to the Enfers,
Bring me the Fury
The most cruel of all three.
Race I have too cherished.
You'll perish this time! ”
Jupiter was not long
To moderate its transport.
O you kings, whom he wanted to do
Referees of our fate,
Let, between anger
And the thunderstorm that follows it,
The interval of one night.
The God whose wing is light.
And the tongue has sweets,
Go to the black sisters.
In Tisiphone and Mégère
He preferred, that say,
The ruthless Alecton.
This choice made her so proud,
That she swore by Pluto
That all human beginness
Would soon be from the domain
Deities from there.
Jupiter did not approve
The oath of the Eumenid.
He sends her away; and yet
He throws lightning at the moment
On some treacherous people.
Thunder, guided by
The very father of those
That he threatened with his fires,
settle for their fear;
He only igned the enclosure
From an uninhabited desert:
Every father knocks next door.
What happened? Our beginness
Took foot on this indulgence.
All Olympus complained about it;
And the cloud assembler
Jura the Styx, and promised
To form other thunderstorms:
They'd be sure. We smile;
They told him he was a father,
And let him leave, for the better,
To someone of the other Gods
Other thunders to do.
Vulcan began the case.
This God fills his furnaces
Two kinds of tiles.
One never gets fused;
And that's the one that always
Olympus in body sends us:
The other deviates in its course;
It is only to the mountains that it costs;
Often even it gets lost,
And the latter on his way
We came from the only Jupiter.
