Death and the Unhappy | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 1 Fable 15

___

A Unfortunate called every day
Death to his rescue.
O Death, he said to him, that you look beautiful to me!
Come quickly, come finish my cruel fortune.
Death believed, in coming, to force him in fact.
She knocks on her door, she comes in, she shows herself.
What do I see? he shouted, take away this thing from me.
He's hideous! that his meeting
Causes me horror and fright!
Do not approach, O death, O death, withdraw.
Mecenas was a gallant man:
He said somewhere, “Let me be made impotent.”
Butt de jatte, gouty, penguin, provided that in short
I live, that's enough, I'm more than happy.
Never come, O dead, we say just as much.
