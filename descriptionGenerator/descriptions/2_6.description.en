The Bird Wounded with an Arrow | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 2 Fable 6

___

Deadly hit with an arrow empenned,
A Bird lamented his sad destiny.
And said in suffering more pain,
Should we contribute to one's own misfortune?
Cruel human, you shoot from our wings
What to make these deadly machines fly;
But do not mock, forgivenessness without mercy:
Often you have a spell like ours.
Children from Japet always half
Will supply weapons to each other.
