The Wolf and the Skinny Dog | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 9 Fable 10

___

Formerly Carpillon
Even though he preached, he had even say,
They put it in the frying pan.
I made it clear that letting go of what we have in our hand,
In the hope of a big adventure,
Is all pure recklessness.
The fisherman was right; Carpillon was not wrong:
Everyone says what he can to defend his life.
Now I need to press
What I was advancing at that time, still in some line.
Some Wolf, as foolish as the fisherman was wise.
Finding a Dog out of the village,
Was going to take it away. The Dog represented
His thinness: “Your Lordship does not please
To take me in that state;
Wait, my master marries.
His only daughter, and you judge
That being a wedding, I must, in spite of me, get fat.”
The Wolf believes it, the Wolf leaves it.
The Wolf, a few days elapse,
Go back to see if his Dog is not better to take;
But the funny one was in the house.
He said to the Wolf by a lattice:
“Friend, I'm going out; and, if you want to wait,
The doorman of the house and me
We will be yours shortly.”
That doorman in the house was a huge dog,
Shipping the wolves in shape.
He suspected it. “Servant to the doorman,”
He said; and to run. He was very agile;
But he wasn't very skillful:
That wolf didn't know his job yet.
