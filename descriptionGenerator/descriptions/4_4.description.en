The Gardener and His Lord | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 4 Fable 4

___

A gardening enthusiast
Half-bourgeois, half-manant,
Own in some village
A fairly clean garden, and the enclosed enclosed.
He had a bright plant closed this expanse.
There happily grew sorrel and lettuce,
What to do to Margot for his party a bouquet,
Little jasmine from Spain, and strength serpolet.
This bliss by a troubled hare
Our man complained to the Lord of the Bourg.
“This damned animal comes to take his goulée
Evening and morning, he said, and pitfalls laughs;
The stones, the sticks lose their credit:
He's a sorcerer, I think. I defy it,
The Lord went away. Was he devil, Miraut,
Despite his tricks, will catch him soon.
I'll give you some, man, about my life.
“And when?” “And tomorrow, without delay any longer.”
The part so made, he comes with his people.
“Let's have lunch,” he said: “Are your chickens tender?”
The daughter of the house, let us see you, come near:
When will we marry her? When will we have sons-in-law?
Man, this is the shot, you hear me.
That we have to search by the scarcelle.”
Saying these words, he gets acquainted with her,
With him makes her seate,
Take a hand, an arm, raise a corner of the handkerchief,
All foolishly including the beautiful
Defends itself with great respect;
As long as the father in the end it becomes suspicious.
However, we're fricting, we're going to the kitchen.
“When are your hams? they look very good.
“Sir, they are yours.” Really! says the Lord,
I receive them, and with good heart.”
He has lunch very well; also makes his family,
Dogs, horses, and jacks, all well-endented people:
He commands the host, takes freedoms,
Drank his wine, caress his daughter.
Hunters' embarrassment follows lunch.
Everyone comes alive and prepares:
The tubes and corns make such a tintamarre
That the man is astonished.
The worse was that they put in a pitiful crew
The poor vegetable garden; farewell planks, tiles;
Goodbye chicory and leeks;
Farewell enough to put soup.
The hare was lying under a master cabbage.
We search for him; we throw him, he runs away by a hole,
Not a hole, but a hole, horrible and wide wound.
That they made to the poor hedge
By the command of the Lord; for it would have been evil
That we couldn't have gotten out of the garden on horseback.
The guy said, “These are prince games.”
But they let him say; and dogs and people
Done more damage in an hour of time
What would have done in a hundred years
All hares in the province.
Little princes, empty your debates between you:
To resort to kings, you'd be crazy.
They must never engage in your wars,
Or bring them into your land.
