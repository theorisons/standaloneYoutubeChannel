The Child and the School Teacher | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 1 Fable 19

___

In this story I pretend to show
From a certain fool the vain remonstrance.
A young child in the water let himself be choice,
By snoozing on the banks of the Seine.
Heaven allowed a willow to be found
Whose connection, after God, saved him.
Having caught himself, I said, in the branches of this willow;
Through this place passes a school teacher.
The Child cries to him, “Help, I perish.”
The Magister turning to his crises,
From a very serious tone to back-time
To tancer him. Ah, the little baboon!
See, he said, where his foolishness put him!
And then take such fripons care.
That parents are unhappy, that it is necessary to
Always watch out for similar scoundrel!
Let them have trouble, and let me pity their fate!
Having said everything, he put the child on board.
I blame more people here than we think.
Every bulletin board, every censor, every pedant,
It may be known from the speech I make:
Each of the three makes a great people;
The Creator has blessed its beginness.
In any matter they are only thinking
 The means to exercise their language.
Hey, my friend, pull me out of danger.
 You'll do after your harangue.
