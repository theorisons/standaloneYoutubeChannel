Man between two ages and his two mistresses | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 1 Fable 17

___

A middle-aged man,
And pulling on the gray,
Jugea it was season
To think about marriage.
He had contant.
And leaving
What to choose from. All wanted to please him;
Why our lover didn't hurry so much.
Addressing well is not a small business.
Two widows on his heart had the most share;
One green, and the other a bit ripe;
But who repaired by his art
What nature had destroyed.
These two widows snooting,
Laughing, celebrating her,
The sometimes went testonning,
That is, adjusting his head.
La Vella at all times on her part took away
A little bit of the black hair that had,
That his lover might be more as he pleases.
The Young was ransacked the white hairs in turn.
Both did as long as our gray head
Done without hair, and doubted the turn.
He said to them, I give you a thousand graces, the Belles,
Who mowed me so well;
I earned more than lost:
Because of Hymen, no news.
The one I would take would like in her own way
I live, not mine.
It is only bald head that holds;
I am obliged to you, Belles, to the lesson.
