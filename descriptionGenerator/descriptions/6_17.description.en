The Dog Who Drop His Prey for the Shadow | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 6 Fable 17

___

Everyone is wrong here on earth:
We see running after the shadow
So many lunatics we don't know
Most of the time the number.
To the Dog of which Aessop speaks, we must send them back.
This Dog, seeing his prey in the water depicted,
She left for the image, and thought she would drown.
The river suddenly became restless;
He barely returned to the borders,
And had neither the shadow nor the body.
