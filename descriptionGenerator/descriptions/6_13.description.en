The Villager and the Snake | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 6 Fable 13

___

Aessop tales that a manant,
Charitable as much as little wise.
A winter day walking
In the area of his inheritance,
Seeking a Snake on the stretched snow,
Transi, frozen, percluse, motionless rendering,
Not having to live for a quarter of an hour.
The villager takes him, takes him to his man,
And, without considering what will be the rent
From an action of this merit,
He stretches it along the house,
Warm him up, revived him.
The numb animal barely smells warm,
Let the soul come back to him with anger.
He raises his head a little, and then whistles immediately;
Then makes a long retreat, then task to make a jump
Against his benefactor, his savior and his father.
“Ungrateful, “said the Manant, “is this my salary?
You will die.” To these words, full of just wrath.
He takes his buck from you, he slices the beast from you;
He makes three snakes of two knots,
A stretch, the tail, and the head.
The insect, jumping, seeks to gather;
But he could not achieve this.
It's good to be charitable:
But to whom? that is the point.
As for the ungrateful, it is not
Who finally dies miserable.
