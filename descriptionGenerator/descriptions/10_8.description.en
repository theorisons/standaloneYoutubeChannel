The Dog whose ears were cut off | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 10 Fable 8

___

“What did I do to see myself like this?
Mutilated by my own Master?
The beautiful state where I am!
In front of the other dogs will I dare to appear?
O kings of animals, or rather their tyrans,
Who would do things like that to you? ”
Thus cried Mouflar, a young dogue; and the people
Not touched by his painful and piercing screes,
They had just cut his ears mercilessly.
Mouflar thought he was losing. He lives with time
That he gained a lot; for being of nature
To plunder his peers, many misadventures
Would have made him go home
With this part in a hundred leagues altered:
Saggy dog always has a torn ear.
The least we can leave someone else's teeth,
It's the best. When you have only one place to defend,
We bring him, for fear of slavery.
Master Mouflar witness armed with a gorgerin,
Of the rest having ear as much as on my hand;
A wolf would not have known where to take it.
