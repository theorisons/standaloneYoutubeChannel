The Rat who withdrew from the world | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 7 Fable 3

___

The Levantines in their legend
Say that a certain Rat, weary of the care of here,
In a Dutch cheese
Withdrew away from the hassle.
The loneliness was depth,
Extending everywhere in the round.
Our new hermit remained in there.
He made so many feet and teeth,
That in a few days he had at the bottom of the hermitage
Living and Coverage: What More Need?
He became fat and fat: God prodigates his possessions
To those who wish to be hers.
One day, to the devotee character
Members of the Rat People's Deputies
They came to ask for some light alms:
They were going to foreign land
Seek some help against the cat people;
Ratopolis was blocked:
They had been forced to leave without money,
Waiting for the indigent state
From the attacked republic.
They asked very little, certain that the help
Would be ready in four or five days.
“My friends, “said the lonely.
The things in this world don't look at me anymore:
How can a poor recluse
Assist you? what can he do,
Than to pray Heaven to help you in this?
I hope he will have some trouble with you.”
Having spoken of this fate,
The new saint closed his door.
Who do I designate, in your opinion,
By that rat so unhelpful?
A monk? No, but a dervis:
I guess a monk is always charitable.
