The Mouse transformed into a girl | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 9 Fable 7

___

A mouse fell from the beak of a Cat Huant:
I wouldn't have picked it up;
But a Bramin did it: I believe it easily;
Every country has its own thought.
The Mouse was very crumpled.
From this kind of next
We care little; but the bramin people
Treat him like a brother. They have in mind
May our soul, coming out of a King,
Enter into a ciron, or into that other beast
Let the Spell please: this is one of the points of law.
Pythagoras at home drew this mystery.
On such a foundation, the Bramin believed to be doing well
To pray to a Sorcerer that he would place the Mouse
In a body she would have had as a host in the past.
The sorcerer made him a girl
From the age of fifteen, and such and so kind,
That Priam's son for her would have tried
Even more than he did for the Greek beauty.
The Bramin was surprised at something so new.
He says to this sweet object:
“You only have to choose, for everyone is jealous
The honor of being your husband.
“In that case I give,” she said,
My voice to the most powerful of all.
“Sun, “cried at the Bramin on his knees,
You're the one who's gonna be our son-in-law.
“No,” he said, “this thick cloud.”
Is more powerful than me, because he hides my traits;
I advise you to take it.
- Well! said the Bramin to the flying cloud,
Were you born for my daughter? “Alas!” no; for the wind
Hunting me for his pleasure from country to country:
I will not undertake on the rights of Boreas.”
The angry Bramin cried out:
“O wind therefore, since wind is,
Come into the arms of our beautiful.”
He ran; a mountain on the way stopped him.
With the teacher passing to this one,
He sends him back and says, “I'll have a quarrel.
With the Rat; and offend him
It would be crazy, he who can pierce me.”
At the word of Rat, the damsel
And he opened his ear, and was the bridegroom.
A rat! — A rat: it's from these blows
What Love does, witness such and such.
But this is said between us.
We always get from the place we came from. This fable
Proves this point quite well; but, seeing it closely,
Somewhat sophism is among its features:
For which husband is not in the sun preferable;
By doing so? Will I say that a giant
Is less strong than a chip? She bites him, though.
The Rat also had to send back, in order to do right,
Beauty at the Cat, Cat at the Dog,
The Dog with the Wolf. By means of
From this circular argument,
Pilpay to the Sun would have finally risen up;
The Sun would have enjoyed the young beauty.
Let us return, if possible, to metempsycosis:
The Bramin sorcerer probably did one thing
Who, far from proving it, shows his falsehood.
I take it right against the Bramin itself;
Because it is necessary, according to its system,
May the Man, the Mouse, the Worm, at last each
To draw his soul from a common treasure:
All are therefore of the same tempering;
But, acting variously
According to the body only,
One rises and the other ramp.
So where does this body so well organized
Could not compel her hostess
To unite with the Sun? A rat had his tenderness!
Everything debated, everything weighted,
The souls of mice and the souls of the beautiful
Are very different among themselves;
We must always return to our destiny,
That is, to the law of Heaven established:
Talk to the devil, use magic,
You shall not turn any being away from its end.
