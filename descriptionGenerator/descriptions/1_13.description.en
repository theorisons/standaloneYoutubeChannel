The Thieves and the Donkey | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 1 Fable 13

___

For a donkey kidnapped two thieves fought:
One wanted to keep it; the other wanted to sell it.
 While punches were trotting,
And that our champions were thinking of defending themselves.
 A third thief arrives.
 Who seizes Master Aliboron.
The Donkey is sometimes a poor Province.
 Thieves are such and such Prince;
Like Transylvans, Turks, and Hungarians.
 Instead of two I met three.
 It's enough of this good,
Of them is often not the conquered Province.
A quarter Thief occurs that grants them net,
 By grabbing the Baudet.
