The Forest and the Lumberjack | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 12 Fable 16

___

A Lumberjack had just broken up or misplaced
The wood he had grabbed his buck.
This loss could not be repaired immediately
Let the Forest be spared some time.
Man at last humbly prays her
To leave him softly
Take a single branch,
In order to make another round:
He would use his livelihood elsewhere;
He would leave standing more oak and more fir trees
Each of whom respected old age and charms.
The innocent forest provides him with other weapons.
She regretted it. He handles his iron:
The wretched does not use it
Than to strip his benefactress
From its main ornaments.
She moans at all times:
His own gift makes his torment.
Here is the train of the world and its sectors:
The benefit is used against the benefactors.
I'm tired of talking about it. But that sweet shadings
Be exposed to such outragees,
Who wouldn't complain about that?
Alas! I may shout and make myself inconvenien,
Ingratitude and abuse
They will be no less fashionable.
