The Two Parrots, the King and His Son | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 10 Fable 11

___

Two parrots, one father and the other son,
From the rst of a King made their ordinary;
Two half-gods, one son and the other father,
Of these birds made their favorites.
Age bind a sincere friendship
Between these people: the two fathers loved each other;
The two children, despite their frivolous heart,
One with the other too was accustomed,
Feed together, and schoolmates.
It was a lot of honor to the young Parrot;
For the child was prince, and his father was monarch.
By the temperament which the Park,
He loved birds. A very covetous sparrow.
And the most lover in the whole province,
Also did his share of the Prince's delicacies.
These two rivals one day together,
As it happens to young people,
The game became a quarrel.
The sparrow, uncircumstate,
Attracted such blows of the beak,
That half-dead and dragging the wing,
It was believed that he could not cure it.
The indignant Prince killed
Her Parrot. The noise came to the father.
The unfortunate old man shouts and desperated,
All in vain; his cries are superfluous;
The talking bird is already in the boat;
To put it better, the bird no longer speaks
That in fury on the Son of the Monarch
His father melts and dies his eyes.
He escapes immediately, and chooses for asylum
The top of a pine tree: there, in the bosom of the God,
He tastes his revenge in a safe and quiet place.
The King himself runs there, and says to lure him:
“Friend, come back home; what is it for us to cry?
Hate, revenge, and mourning, let's leave everything at the door.
I am compelled to state,
So that my pain is strong,
Let evil come from us; my son was the aggressor;
My son! no; it is the Spell that is the author.
The Parque had always written in his book,
That one of our children was to stop living.
The other to see, by this misfortune.
Let us both comfort and come back in your cage.”
The parrot says, “Sire King,
Do you think that after such a contempt
Should I trust you?
You allege the Spell to me: pretend, by your faith,
Lure me from the bait of a layman language?
But that Providence, or Fate,
Adjusts the affairs of the world,
It says up there that at the top of this pine tree
Or in some deep forest,
I will end my days away from the fatal object
Who must be a right subject to you
Hate and fury. I know revenge
Is a piece of king; for ye live as gods.
You want to forget this offense;
I believe it: however, I need, for the better,
Avoid your hand and eyes.
Sire King my friend; go away, you lose your sorrow:
Don't talk to me back;
Absence is also a cure for hatred
A device against love.”
