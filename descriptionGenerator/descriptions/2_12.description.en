The Dove and the Ant  | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 2 Fable 12

___


The other example is taken from smaller animals.
Along a clear stream drank a Dove:
When on the water leaning an ant falls there.
And in this Ocean we would have seen the Ant
Strive, but in vain, to return to shore.
The Dove immediately used charity.
A sprig of grass in the water by it being thrown out,
It was a promontory where the Ant arrives.
She's escaping; and on it
Pass a Crunchy who walked barefoot.
That crunchy by chance had a crossbow.
As soon as he sees the Bird of Venus
He believes him in his pot, and already celebrates him.
While my Villager is about to kill him...
The Ant stings it in the heel.
The Naughty flips his head.
The Dove hears it, leaves, and shoots long.
The crunchy supper with her flies away:
Pigeon point for a obole.
