The Pastre and the Lion | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 6 Fable 1

___

Fables are not what they seem to be;
The simplest animal is our master.
A naked morality brings boredom:
The tale passes the precept with him.
In these kinds of feint it is necessary to teach and please;
And storytelling for storytelling seems to me little business.
It is for this reason that brighten their mind,
Many such famous people have written.
All fled the ornament and too much expanse.
There is no lost word in them.
Phedron was so succinct that some blamed him;
Essop in less words spoke again.
But on all certain Greek hears, and stings himself
Laconic elegance;
It always contains his tale in four verses;
Good or bad, I leave him to judge the experts.
Let's see him with Aessop in a similar subject.
One brings a hunter, the other a pastre, into his fable.
I followed their project about the event,
Sewing there on the way only some line.
Here is as, roughly, Aessop recounts:
A pastre, to his sheep finding some miscount,
Wanted to all force catch the thief.
It goes near a den, and tends to the approximately
Lakes to take wolves, suspicion of this spawning.
Before leaving these places:
“If you do, “he said, “O monarch of the God,
Let the funny one at these lakes take me in my presence,
And that I taste this pleasure,
Among twenty calves I want to choose
The fatest, and make an offering.”
At these words comes out of the den a great and strong Lion;
The Pastre clawed, and said half dead:
“What man does not know, alas! what he asks!
To find the thief who destroys my herd,
And seeing him in those lakes caught before I left,
O monarch of the Gods, I have promised you a calf:
I promise you an ox if you make it go away.
This is how the main author said:
Let's move on to his copycat.
