The Sick Lion and the Fox | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 6 Fable 14

___

From the King of Animals,
Who in his den was sick,
Was made known to his vassals
That every species in embassy
Send people to visit it;
Under promise to treat well
The deputies, themselves and their follow,
Faith of Leo, very well written:
Good passport against the teeth,
Against the claw just as much.
The Prince's Edit executes:
From each species we depute him.
The Foxes keeping the house,
One of them says this reason:
“The footsteps imbued on the dust
By those who go to the sick their court,
All, without exception, look at his den;
Not a return mark:
This puts us in suspicion.
May Her Majesty give us:
Thank you very much for his passport.
I think he's good: but in this den
I can see very well how one is going in,
And don't see how we're coming out of it.”
