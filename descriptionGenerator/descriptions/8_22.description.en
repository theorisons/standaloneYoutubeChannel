The Cat and the Rat | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 8 Fable 22

___

Four different animals, the Cat flu cheese,
Sir-bird the Owl, mesh ew the Rat,
Lady weasel with long bodice
All people of evil mind,
Haunted the rotten trunk of an old and wild pine.
So many were there, that one evening around this pine tree
The man stretched out his nets. The Cat, early morning
Come out to get his prey.
The last strokes of the shadow prevent it from
The net: there falls in danger of dying;
And my Cat screaming, and the Rat to drie,
One full of despair, and the other full of joy:
He saw in the lakes his deadly enemy.
Poor Cat says, “Dear friend,
The marks of your benevolence
Are common in my place;
Come help me out of the trap where ignorance
Dropped me. It's right.
Let alone among yours, out of singular love,
I always pampered you, loving you like my eyes.
I have no regret for it, and I give thanks to the Gods.
I was going to give them my prayer;
Like every devotee Cat wears it out in the mornings,
This network holds me back: my life is in your hands;
Come dissolve these knots. — And what a reward
Will I get some? took the Rat.
— I swear eternal covenant
With you, the Cat left.
Have my claw, and be confident:
Against and against all I will protect you;
And the weasel will eat
With the husband of the Chouette:
They're both mad at you.” The rat says, “You idiot!
Me your liberator? I'm not so foolish.”
Then he goes to retirement.
The weasel was near the hole.
The Rat climbs higher; he sees the Owl.
Hazards on all sides: the most pressing wins.
Ronge-mesh returns to the Cat, and makes sure
Let him untie one link, then another, and then aunting,
Let him finally clear the hypocrite.
Man appears at this moment;
The new allies are both fleeing.
Some time away, our Cat lives from afar
His Rat standing on alert and on guard:
“Ah! “my brother, “he said, “come and kiss me; your care
Insults me; you look at
As an enemy your ally.
Do you think I forgot
What after God I owe you life?
“And I, “replied the Rat, “do you think I forget
Your naturalness? No Treaties
Can he force a cat to reconnaissance?
Are we sure on the covenant
What did the necessity do?
