The Falcon and the Chapon | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 8 Fable 21

___

A traitor voice often calls you;
So do not hurry:
He wasn't a fool, no, no, and believe me.
That Jean de Nivelle's Dog.
A citizen of Le Mans, chapter of his profession
Was summoned to appear
In front of the master's lares,
At the foot of a court we call home.
All the people were yelling at him, disguising the thing:
“Little, little, little! But, far from reliing on it,
The Norman and a half let people scream.
“Servant, “he said; “Your bait is rude:
They don't care about me; and for good reason.”
However, a Falcon on his perch saw
Our manceau running away.
The chapons have very little trust in us,
Either instinct or experience.
This one, who was barely catched,
Must, the next day, be of a big supper,
Strong at ease in a dish, honor of which poultry
It would have happened easily.
The hunting bird said to him, “Your little understanding
Makes me all amazed. You're just a scum.
Rude people, mindless, to whom you don't teach anything.
For me, I know how to hunt, and get back to the master.
Don't you see him in the window?
He's waiting for you: are you deaf? “I hear only too well,
The chapon went away, but what does he mean to me?
What about that handsome cook armed with a big knife?
Would you come back for that call?
Let me run away; stop laughing
The indocility that makes me fly up,
When in such a soft tone they come to call me.
If you saw it on the pin
Every day as many hawks
That I see putting chapers,
You would not blame me like that.”
