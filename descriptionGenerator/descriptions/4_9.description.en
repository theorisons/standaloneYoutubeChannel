The Jay adorned with Peacock Feathers | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 4 Fable 9

___

A peacock molted; a jay took his plumage;
Then then he accommodated himself;
Then among other peacocks all proud himself panada,
Believing to be a beautiful character.
Someone recognized him: he saw himself flouted.
Blind, whistled, mocked, played,
And by gentlemen the Peacocks plucked strange way;
Even to his like men having taken refuge in the country,
He was put to the door by them.
He's enough two-foot jays like him,
Who often adorn himself with the remains of others,
And called plagiaries.
I am not sure; and I will not cause them any trouble.
That's not my business.
