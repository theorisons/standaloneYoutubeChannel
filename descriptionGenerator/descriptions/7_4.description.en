The Heron | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 7 Fable 4

___

One day, on his long feet, went, I don't know where,
The Heron with a long beak with a long neck:
He was next to a river.
The wave was transparent as well as on the most beautiful days;
My gossip Carp was doing a thousand tricks there
With Pike his companus.
The Heron would have made his profit easily:
All were approaching the edge; the bird had only to take.
But he thought it was better to wait
That he had a little more appetite:
He lived on a diet, and ate in his hours.
After a few moments the appetite came: the bird,
Approaching the edge, lives on the water
Tenches coming out of the bottom of these mansions.
He did not like the food; he expected it better,
And showed a disdainous taste,
Like the rat of the good Horace.
“Me, tenches! he said; I, Heron, let me do
Oh, such a poor dear. And who am I taken for? ”
With the tench put off, he found stud.
“Stud! This is the dinner of a Heron!
I'd open the beak for so little! to the Gods forbid! ”
He opened it for much less: everything went so
Let him not see any fish anymore.
Hunger took him: he was happy and comfortable
To meet a silt.
Let's not be so difficult:
The most accommodating are the most skillful;
You risk losing by wanting to win too much.
Beware of nothing disdain;
Especially when you have pretty much your account.
Many people are caught in it. It's not herons.
Let me speak: listen, humans, another tale;
You will see that in your home I have drawn these lessons.
