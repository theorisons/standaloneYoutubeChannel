The Bat, the Bush and the Duck | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 12 Fable 7

___

The Bush, the Duck, and the Bat.
Seeing all three that in their country
They made little fortune,
Will trade in the distance, and make a common stock exchange.
They had counters, factors,
No less careful than intelligent,
Accurate books of bet and recipe.
Everything was fine, when they were...
Passing through some places
Filled with pitfalls and very narrow,
And of very difficult journey,
Alla all packed at the bottom of the shops
Which of the Tartar are neighbors.
Our trio pushed many unnecessary regret;
Or rather he did not push:
The smallest merchant is a scientist on this point.
To save his credit, you have to hide his loss.
The one that, unfortunate, our people had suffered
Could not repair itself: the case was discovered.
Here they are without credit, without money, without resource,
Ready to wear the green cap.
None opened their purse.
And the main fate, and the big interests,
And the sergeants, and the trials,
And the creditor at the door,
Right in front of the day
Only occupied the trio to look for a lot of detour
To please this cohort.
The Bush hung passers-by at all times.
“Gentlemen,” he said, “by grace, teach us
Where are the goods
That some chasm have taken us.”
The plunge under the waters was going to get them.
The Bat Bird Dared No More Approach
During the zero day remains:
Follow-up of sergeants at all hours,
In holes he was going to hide.
I know many people who are neither bald-mouse,
Neither bush, nor duck, nor in such case fall,
But simple great lord, who every day escapes
By a stolen staircase.
