The Bassa and the Merchant | Jean de la Fontaine | Book 8 Fable 18

___

A Greek merchant in certain land
Was trafficking. A Bassa supported him;
What the Greek in bassa paid him for.
Not in merchant: so expensive commodity
A protector! This cost alty,
That our Greek was going everywhere complaining.
Three other Turks, of a lesser rank in power,
He will offer their support in common.
The three of them wanted less recognition
That the Merchant didn't cost it for one.
The Greek listens; with them he engages;
And the Bassa at all is warned:
Even we tell him he'll play, if he's wise.
To these people some nasty parte,
warning them, loading them with a message
For Mohammed, right in his paradise,
And without delay; otherwise, these people united
will warn him, although certain that in the round
He has people ready to avenge him:
Some poison will send him to protect
The traffickers who are in the other world.
On this opinion the Turk behaved
Like Alexander; and, full of trust,
To the merchant straight away he goes away.
He sat down at the table. We live so much insurance
In these speeches and in all its maintenences,
Let it not be believed that he had any suspicious of anything.
“Friend, “he said, “I know that you are leaving me;
Even I want to fear the aftermath;
But I think you're too good.
You don't look like a beverage donor.
I do not say any more about that.
As for those people who think they support you,
Listen to me: without so much dialogue,
And reasons that might bother you,
I only want to tell you an apologist.
He was a Shepherd, his Dog, and his flock.
Someone asked him what he claimed to be doing
From a dane of whom the ordinary
Was a whole bread. It had to be good and beautiful
Give this animal to the village lord.
He, shepherd, for more cleaning
Would have two or three mastids;
Who, spending less on him, would look after the herds
Much better than that beast alone.
He ate more than three; but they did not say
That he also had a triple mouth
When wolves were fighting.
The Shepherd discarded; he takes three size dogs
To spend less on him, but to flee the battle.
The flock felt it, and you will feel
From the choice of similar scoundrel.
If you do well, you will come back to me.”
The Greek believed it. This shows the provinces
That, all counted, better in good faith,
Surrender to some mighty King,
Than to lean on several little princes.
